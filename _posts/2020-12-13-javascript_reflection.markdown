Coming into the JavaScript module, I was pumped. I had previously fiddled around with JS a bit, and was ready to gain a deeper understanding. But I quickly realized that it wasn’t going to be as easy as I first imagined. The lessons and labs were expecting a lot more of us than they had during the Ruby modules, leaving many of us with questions still burning. 

As with most of the projects, I spent a fair amount of time just trying to decide what problem I would tackle. I was originally going to expand on my Rails project, but I ended up going down a whole different rabbit-hole. 

I am an avid subscriber to free-trials; if it’s free, I’m there. I often try and get others to do it with me, but they complain that they “forget to unsubscribe,” and end up getting charged when the trial is up. To solve this I thought I’d create a tracker of free-trial subscriptions. 

The big picture of this application would involve user-authentication, but we were advised against that since it hadn’t yet been covered. So I ended up creating a simple list of families whose subscriptions could be added to and edited to reflect whether they had been cancelled.

I struggled with working with the fetch requests, they are so powerful and unfortunately a little mysterious. While I was frustrated that I couldn’t find strict solutions in the lessons, during project week I realized this was because JS has no strict solutions. If it works, it works. There are more efficient ways to operate, but those modifications mostly come into effect with larger scale applications (ie. not my homegrown one).

As with all the projects, I wish I had time to build out this application into the one I see in my mind. But for now, I’m just happy to have the minimum viable product!
