An excess of time used to only exist in dreams, with the current pandemic and subsequent global shutdown, those dreams have suddenly become a reality for most of us. While at first this was a welcome change to the daily eat-work-sleep loop, as I neared the end of “Tiger King,” and started dreaming up my new life on Doc Antle’s safari, I realized that this dream was getting the best of me.

In high school I spent one summer dipping my toes in C, even though I found it to be interesting I did not pursue it in college, and it wasn’t until this past January that I jumped back in. Browsing job postings, it quickly becomes clear that the Software Engineering industry is expanding. The expectation of a working knowledge of code is no longer the future, it is now. I decided to put my overactive mind to work, and finish learning how to code. 

It has been many years coming, and will hopefully be many years going. Because what excites me about Software Engineering is that you can never stop learning, once you do, you risk obsolescence.
