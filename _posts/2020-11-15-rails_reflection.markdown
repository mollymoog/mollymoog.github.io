As we cross this halfway mark of the bootcamp, I am torn between relief that we are over the hump, and fear of the more difficult lessons to come. 

The fact that each section builds on what comes before it, means that I have future opportunities to perfect what I may have missed, but it also means that there are that many more parts that I need to pay attention to. 

As with life, bootcamp doesnâ€™t wait for you, you just gotta keep up. The final projects of each section are never the perfect versions I go into project-week imagining them to be. The hard part is reminding myself, that that is also okay. Coming out with a working demo that can be expanded on in the future is also useful.
